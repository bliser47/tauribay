<p>Minor Glyphs do not provide you with any worthwhile benefits. Many of them offer cosmetic improvements that you will probably want to check out. Two glyphs, however, are worth mentioning.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="spell_icon_span"><img class="spell_icon" src="http://mop-static.tauri.hu/images/icons/medium/inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png" alt="Glyph of Bloody Healing Icon"> <a class="glyph" href="http://mop-shoot.tauri.hu/?item=43412" rel="nofollow">Glyph of Bloody Healing</a></span> increases the amount of healing you receive from bandages by 20%, while you have <span class="spell_icon_span"><img class="spell_icon" src="http://mop-static.tauri.hu/images/icons/medium/ability_backstab.png" alt="Deep Wounds Icon"> <a class="spell" href="http://mop-shoot.tauri.hu/?spell=115768" rel="nofollow">Deep Wounds</a></span> (passively applied as part of your normal rotation) up on at least one target. Since bandages are seldom used, its benefit will probably be very minor.</li>
    <li><span class="spell_icon_span"><img class="spell_icon" src="http://mop-static.tauri.hu/images/icons/medium/inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png" alt="Glyph of Intimidating Shout Icon"> <a class="glyph" href="http://mop-shoot.tauri.hu/?item=45794" rel="nofollow">Glyph of Intimidating Shout</a></span> changes your <span class="spell_icon_span"><img class="spell_icon" src="http://mop-static.tauri.hu/images/icons/medium/ability_golemthunderclap.png" alt="Intimidating Shout Icon"> <a class="spell" href="http://mop-shoot.tauri.hu/?spell=5246" rel="nofollow">Intimidating Shout</a></span> to no longer cause the enemies to run around in fear. Instead, they will simply stand still for the duration of the fear. This is very useful when you wish to avoid the feared mobs aggroing other packs.</li>
